Download Mulg Level and put them on your sd-card under "/roms/mulg"!


There is also an experimental wifi multiplayer mode. Download the level Werner2.pdb from /level and get two odroid-go. On the master start the first level of Werner2.pdb and press "start"+"right". Then start any level on the client and press "start"+"left". Un-pause the game on the master and both odroids should link. If the game seems to lack, pause the master for a moment and it will be better (known bug)...
